      "description": "### Impact\n\nWaitress would parse the `Transfer-Encoding` header and only look for a single string value, if that value was not `chunked` it would fall through and use the `Content-Length` header instead.\n\nAccording to the HTTP standard `Transfer-Encoding` should be a comma separated list, with the inner-most encoding first, followed by any further transfer codings, ending with `chunked`.\n\nRequests sent with:\n\n```\nTransfer-Encoding: gzip, chunked\n```\n\nWould incorrectly get ignored, and the request would use a `Content-Length` header instead to determine the body size of the HTTP message.\n\nThis could allow for Waitress to treat a single request as multiple requests in the case of HTTP pipelining.\n\n### Patches\n\nThis issue is fixed in Waitress 1.4.0. This brings a range of changes to harden Waitress against potential HTTP request confusions, and may change the behaviour of Waitress behind non-conformist proxies. \n\nWaitress will now return a 501 Not Implemented error if the `Transfer-Encoding` is not `chunked` or contains multiple elements. Waitress does not support any transfer codings such as `gzip` or `deflate`.\n\nThe Pylons Project recommends upgrading as soon as possible, while validating that the changes in Waitress don&#39;t cause any changes in behavior.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nVarious reverse proxies may have protections against sending potentially bad HTTP requests to the backend, and or hardening against potential issues like this. If the reverse proxy doesn&#39;t use HTTP/1.1 for connecting to the backend issues are also somewhat mitigated, as HTTP pipelining does not exist in HTTP/1.0 and Waitress will close the connection after every single request (unless the Keep Alive header is explicitly sent... so this is not a fool proof security method).\n\n### Issues/more security issues:\n\n* open an issue at https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/issues (if not sensitive or security related)\n* email the Pylons Security mailing list: pylons-project-security@googlegroups.com (if security related)",

      "description": "### Impact\n\nWhen using Waitress behind a proxy that does not properly validate the incoming HTTP request matches the RFC7230 standard, Waitress and the frontend proxy may disagree on where one request starts and where it ends.\n\nThis would allow requests to be smuggled via the front-end proxy to waitress and later behavior.\n\nThere are two classes of vulnerability that may lead to request smuggling that are addressed by this advisory:\n\n- The use of Python's `int()` to parse strings into integers, leading to `+10` to be parsed as `10`, or `0x01` to be parsed as `1`, where as the standard specifies that the string should contain only digits or hex digits.\n- Waitress does not support chunk extensions, however it was discarding them without validating that they did not contain illegal characters\n\n### Patches\n\nThis has been fixed in Waitress 2.1.1\n\n### Workarounds\n\nWhen deploying a proxy in front of waitress, turning on any and all functionality to make sure that the request matches the RFC7230 standard. Certain proxy servers may not have this functionality though and users are encouraged to upgrade to the latest version of waitress instead.\n\n### References\n\n- https://portswigger.net/research/http-desync-attacks-request-smuggling-reborn\n\n### For more information\n\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Open an issue in [the Github issue tracker](https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/issues) (if not security related/sensitive)\n* Email us at [pylons-project-security@googlegroups.com](mailto:pylons-project-security@googlegroups.com) (If security related or sensitive)\n",

      "title": "HTTP Request Smuggling: LF vs CRLF handling in Waitress",
      "description": "### Impact\n\nWaitress implemented a &amp;quot;MAY&amp;quot; part of the RFC7230 (https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230#section-3.5) which states:\n\n      Although the line terminator for the start-line and header fields is\n      the sequence CRLF, a recipient MAY recognize a single LF as a line\n      terminator and ignore any preceding CR.\n\nUnfortunately if a front-end server does not parse header fields with an LF the same way as it does those with a CRLF it can lead to the front-end and the back-end server parsing the same HTTP message in two different ways. This can lead to a potential for HTTP request smuggling/splitting whereby Waitress may see two requests while the front-end server only sees a single HTTP message.\n\nExample:\n\n```\nContent-Length: 100[CRLF]\nX-Header: x[LF]Content-Length: 0[CRLF]\n```\n\nWould get treated by Waitress as if it were:\n\n```\nContent-Length: 100\nX-Header: x\nContent-Length: 0\n```\n\nThis could potentially get used by attackers to split the HTTP request and smuggle a second request in the body of the first.\n\n\n### Patches\n\nThis issue is fixed in Waitress 1.4.0. This brings a range of changes to harden Waitress against potential HTTP request confusions, and may change the behaviour of Waitress behind non-conformist proxies. \n\nWaitress no longer implements the MAY part of the specification and instead requires that all lines are terminated correctly with CRLF. If any lines are found with a bare CR or LF a 400 Bad Request is sent back to the requesting entity.\n\nThe Pylons Project recommends upgrading as soon as possible, while validating that the changes in Waitress don&amp;#39;t cause any changes in behavior.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nVarious reverse proxies may have protections against sending potentially bad HTTP requests to the backend, and or hardening against potential issues like this. If the reverse proxy doesn&amp;#39;t use HTTP/1.1 for connecting to the backend issues are also somewhat mitigated, as HTTP pipelining does not exist in HTTP/1.0 and Waitress will close the connection after every single request (unless the Keep Alive header is explicitly sent... so this is not a fool proof security method)\n\n### Issues/more security issues:\n\n* open an issue at https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/issues (if not sensitive or security related)\n* email the Pylons Security mailing list: pylons-project-security@googlegroups.com (if security related)",

      "description": "### Impact\n\nWaitress may terminate early due to a thread closing a socket while the main thread is about to call select(). This will lead to the main thread raising an exception that is not handled and then causing the entire application to be killed.\n\n### Patches\n\nThis issue has been fixed in Waitress 2.1.2 by no longer allowing the WSGI thread to close the socket, instead it is always delegated to the main thread.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nThere is no work-around, however users using waitress behind a reverse proxy server are less likely to have issues if the reverse proxy always reads the full response.\n\n### For more information\n\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Open an issue in https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/issues (if not sensitive or security related)\n* email the Pylons Security mailing list: [pylons-project-security@googlegroups.com](mailto:pylons-project-security@googlegroups.com) (if security related)\n",
